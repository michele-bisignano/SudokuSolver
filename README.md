# SudokuSolver

SudokuSolver is an application that creates and solves Sudoku puzzles. 🎲🧩

## Main Features

- **Unique Solving Techniques**: The uniqueness of this app is that it does not solve Sudoku using the brute force method, but uses solving techniques autonomously developed by the developer. 🧠✨
- **Brute Force as Last Resort**: The brute force algorithm is executed only if other techniques are not sufficient for the resolution, and in this case, the user is notified. 🚨
- **User Interface**: Although I did not create all the images for the game, I took care of the graphics, creating the user interface. 🎨🖌️

## Developer
