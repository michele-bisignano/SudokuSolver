# SudokuSolver 🎯

SudokuSolver is an application that creates and solves Sudoku puzzles, developed in **Unity** and **C#**. 🎲🧩

## 🏆 Main Features

- **Unique Solving Techniques**: This application does not rely on brute force to solve Sudoku puzzles. Instead, it uses solving techniques autonomously developed by the developer. 🧠✨
- **Brute Force as Last Resort**: The brute force algorithm is executed only if other techniques are not sufficient for the resolution, and in this case, the user is notified. 🚨
- **User Interface**: While not all images in the game were created by me, I designed the graphical user interface. 🎨🖌️

## 📝 Development Approach

The development of this application prioritized **algorithmic complexity and logical efficiency** over strict adherence to object-oriented programming principles. The primary focus was on crafting **sophisticated solving algorithms** and optimizing the **execution flow**, ensuring an effective and intelligent Sudoku-solving process. 

Rather than emphasizing class structures, inheritance, or encapsulation, the goal was to develop **high-performance logic** capable of solving puzzles efficiently. This means that while the project may not strictly follow OOP best practices, it delivers a powerful and optimized Sudoku-solving experience.

## 👨‍💻 Developer
