# SudokuSolver 🎯

SudokuSolver is an application that creates and solves Sudoku puzzles, developed in **Unity** and **C#**. 🎲🧩

## 🏆 Main Features

- **Unique Solving Techniques**: This application does not rely on brute force to solve Sudoku puzzles. Instead, it uses solving techniques autonomously developed by the developer. 🧠✨
- **Brute Force as Last Resort**: The brute force algorithm is executed only if other techniques are not sufficient for the resolution, and in this case, the user is notified. 🚨
- **User Interface**: While not all images in the game were created by me, I designed the graphical user interface. 🎨🖌️

## 👨‍💻 Developer

I personally developed the entire code for this application. 💻👨‍💻
